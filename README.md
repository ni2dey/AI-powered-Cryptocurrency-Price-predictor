# 💰 AI-Powered Bitcoin Price Predictor

This is an AI-driven web application that predicts the future price of Bitcoin using historical data and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The system combines a sleek frontend interface with a powerful Flask backend and machine learning model to provide real-time predictions.

📌 Project Overview:

    The Bitcoin Price Predictor allows users to:
    
    Fetch the latest Bitcoin price data via an external API
    
    Visualize historical trends
    
    Predict future prices using a trained LSTM model

    Interact with a responsive, intuitive UI built using modern web technologies

🧠 Tech Stack:

  🔧 Frontend

      HTML5
      
      CSS3
      
      JavaScript

  🖥️ Backend
  
    Python (Flask) – Web server & routing
    
    LSTM Model (Keras/TensorFlow) – Price prediction model
    
    API Integration – Real-time price fetching

📈 How It Works:

    The app fetches recent Bitcoin price data through an API.
    
    Historical data is processed and fed into a pre-trained LSTM model.
    
    The model predicts future values based on past trends.
    
    The result is sent to the frontend and displayed in a user-friendly format.
